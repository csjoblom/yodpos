a project to resurrect a dead maytag dishwasher using a rpi zero w 

## required stuff
* a working dishwasher with a broken control panel (mine is a maytag Mdbh949aww1)
* a rpi zero w
* a soldering kit
* a micrometer
* plumbing stuff to remove/add dishwasher (pro tip a wine cork will plug a garbage disposal inlet at least for me)
* screwdrivers for your dumb dishwasher
* a 12v to microusb converter

## TODO
* Map out wiring
* Map out gpio on rpi
* Build service to replace control panel functionality
* Build interface to allow access via website/chatbot
